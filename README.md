# Rat
C++ RAT , This is first version, (I've done coding the full version long time ago but lost the source.. Will recode it and upload ) 
Very simple and clean Includes Server-Client , And some nice functionality.
using Windows API threads.

The full version has : 
    DKOM, Direct Kernel Object Maninpulation to hide the process from the OS.
    Sending Screen-shot of the victim.

This is home-made version just for practice and fun, So havnt done fancy things like using IRC to communicate and etc..
