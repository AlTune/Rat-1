# Rat
C++ RAT , This is first version, (Currently working on DKOM technique and screenshot.)
Very simple and clean Includes Server-Client , And some nice functionality.
using Windows API threads.

Working at the moment on : 
    DKOM, Direct Kernel Object Maninpulation to hide the process from the OS.
    Sending Screen-shot of the victim.
    
On windows XP:
    Hide important files from the file explorer. DONE

This is home-made version just for practice and fun, So havnt done fancy things like using IRC to communicate and etc..
